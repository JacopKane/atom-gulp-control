# Atom gulp-control

## What

Displays gulp tasks and allows execution with a single click.

Tasks can be re-started, tracked and controlled from a central point. Open the control from tha package menu and you are good to go.

NOTE: This has not been tested on Windows in this release, it is on the list of things to get to. Hang tight. The gulp & node combination is quite finicky about paths.
